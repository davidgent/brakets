event handling demo
This was a testing excersise to create events and practice using the DOM.

Input value is checked to make sure a value is entered and if changed the counter displayed is reset.
Also messages are displayed depsnding on weatherthe value entered has been reached or if a value needs to be entered.

Also if the menu is clicked a done class is applied and toggled or if hovered on another class is applied to change colour to red.
